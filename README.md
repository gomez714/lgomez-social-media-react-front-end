# Artists Integrate(v1)

This repository is the frontend for a site I created called [Artists Integrate](https://lgomez-social-media.web.app/).

The idea behind it stemmed from the need for artists of all disciplines to collaborate in their own space during the pandemic. Especially for performing artists, it has gotten harder for them to partake in events like performances. Here they would be able to share pieces of work and other artists could respond with feedback or their artistic response (e.g. a dance that someone performed to a song that was shared). 

### Future Improvements:
- As of right now, posts that artists share can only hold text, but I would like to add the ability to hold media as well.
- Although users can follow one another, I plan to implement private messaging between users.
